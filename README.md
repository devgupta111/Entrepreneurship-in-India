# Entrepreneurship Trends in India

A data-driven analysis of entrepreneurship research trends in India from 1976 to 2024, conducted between August 2024 â€“ December 2024. This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an original dataset of 3,249 entries, which was refined to 2,523 records after data cleaning. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used for analysis. The study explores publication patterns, country collaborations, open-access distribution, and key themes like innovation and business development in the entrepreneurship research landscape of India.


- Trends in entrepreneurship research publications over time (1976-2024).
- Analysis of document types (articles, reviews, and conference papers).
- Top contributing authors, journals, and publishers.
- Key research collaborations between India and other countries (e.g., India-United States, India-United Kingdom).
- Open-access trends and citation distribution.
- Word cloud representation of key research themes.
- Funding trends and publisher contributions to entrepreneurship research.

## Features

- **Comprehensive EDA**: Analyzes 2,523 entrepreneurship-related research entries from 1976 to 2024.
- **Trends in Research Output**: Visualization of publication growth, decade-wise trends, and peak research activity periods.
- **Research Collaboration Analysis**: Identifies the most common international collaborations, particularly India's ties with the United States, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, and other countries.
- **Document Type Classification**: Breaks down research into articles, reviews, and conference papers while analyzing their impact and citation count.
- **Open Access Insights**: Examines the percentage of open-access vs. non-open-access entrepreneurship research.
- **Top Research Contributors**: Identifies the most influential authors, journals, and publishers in the entrepreneurship domain.
- **Word Cloud Analysis**: Summarizes research themes by extracting frequently used keywords related to entrepreneurship.

## Data and Methodology

**Dataset:** `scopus.csv (Original dataset, 3,249 records) and scopus(filtered).csv (Refined dataset, 2,523 records)` (Refined dataset of 2,523 entries, originally 3,249 records.)

### **Data Cleaning Process:**

- Removed non-English documents (French, Spanish, and other non-English records).
- Excluded data entries from 2025.
- Standardized author names and assigned unique IDs.
- Filtered document types (articles, reviews, conference papers).
- Converted open-access data into binary categories (1 = open access, 0 = non-open access).
- Identified top 10 journals and publishers based on total papers and citations.
- Created a word cloud using common author keywords.
- Extracted and analyzed country-based affiliations.
- Investigated funding sources and contributions of Indian publishers.

**Methodology:**

- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).
- Analyzed decade-wise trends in entrepreneurship research (1999-2024).
- Categorized document types (article, review, conference papers) and analyzed their impact on citations.
- Mapped global collaborations, highlighting top country pairs (e.g., India-United States, India-United Kingdom, India-Malaysia, etc.).
- Assessed open-access trends, identifying various types (Gold, Bronze, Hybrid, Green, and Non-Open Access).
- Examined top research journals, influential authors, and key publishers based on citation impact.
- Generated visual insights using graphs, bar charts, and word clouds.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis:

- **Entrepreneurship research in India has grown significantly**, from 13 papers (1999-2000) to **1,147 papers published between 2021-2024**.
- **Declining citation rates**: While total citations increased (22,226 total), the average citations per paper dropped from **33 (1999-2000) to 4.62 (2021-2024)**, possibly due to the increasing number of published papers diluting the overall citation impact.
- **Research Type Distribution**: Articles make up **84.74%** of the dataset, followed by reviews (**10.66%**) and conference papers (**4.59%**). Despite their smaller count, review articles have higher average citation counts than conference papers.
- **Collaboration Insights**: India is a major global research hub, collaborating significantly with the **United States (173 papers) and the United Kingdom (90 papers)**. Emerging research relationships with Malaysia, France, and Saudi Arabia have also been identified.
- **Open Access Trends**: Only **18% of entrepreneurship-related publications are open access**, with the majority (81.8%) being non-open access. Gold Open Access papers account for only 8.05%, followed by Bronze (4.2%), Hybrid Gold (2.73%), and Green Open Access (1.94%).
- **Geographic Insights**: The United States leads in terms of publication count (266 papers), followed by the United Kingdom (107) and Malaysia (78). India is a key contributor, especially in global collaborations.
- **Most Influential Journals and Publishers**: The study identifies leading journals like *Emerald Emerging Markets Case Studies*, *Journal of Entrepreneurship*, and publications from top publishers like Elsevier, John Wiley & Sons, and Inderscience Publishers.

## Conclusion

This research confirms that **entrepreneurship in India has significantly grown from 1976 to 2024**, with increasing publications, strong global collaborations, and an expanding focus on topics like **innovation, social entrepreneurship, and business development**. India has played a central role in global entrepreneurship research, particularly in collaboration with the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the decline in average citations per paper raises concerns about research impact, emphasizing the need for higher-quality studies. **Open access remains limited,** with only 18% of publications freely accessible, suggesting the need for policies promoting greater accessibility.

Overall, this study provides key insights into the **entrepreneurial research landscape in India**, helping policymakers, researchers, and institutions understand emerging trends and challenges in this evolving field.
